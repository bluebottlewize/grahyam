# grahyam
A simple Malayalam Handwriting Recognition Model built from scratch.   

# This is a work in progress!
This is very much a work in progress. We need much more handwritten data to support more letters and stuff.    
Feel free to contribute using the [Lipi android app](https://github.com/bluebottlewize/lipi).

## How It Works
The lstm model take a sequence of touch point coordinates and spits out the corresponding Malayalam character.

## Dataset
You can find the touch point dataset in the `train` and `test` folder.
